                    <p>Referred to as the Venice of the East, Alappuzha has always enjoyed an important place in the maritime history of Kerala. Today, it is famous for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches, marine products and coir industry. Alappuzha Beach is a popular picnic spot. The pier, which extends out to the sea here, is over 137 years old. Entertainment facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to the attraction of the beach. There is also an old lighthouse nearby which greatly intrigues all visitors.Another delightful experience while in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The houseboats you find in the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’, refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days, kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices. Of late, houseboats come equipped with all the comforts of a good hotel room including furnished bedrooms, modern toilets, cozy living rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling. An uninterrupted view of life in the backwaters can be enjoyed while staying in a houseboat.</p>

                    <p>Small crowds can be seen making their way throughout the year to a site located about 5 km east of Ambalappuzha in Alappuzha district. The destination is the Karumadi Kuttan, a renowned Buddhist pilgrim centre, wherein lies a special Buddha statue that dates back to the 11th century. Made of solid black granite, the entire site is today under the protection of Kerala Archaeology Department. People from across the nation and abroad come here to pay homage and seek blessings, as stories about its wonderful healing properties have spread far and wide.</p>

                    <img src="images/alappuzha/Krishnapuram_Palace_Alappuzha_2474.JPG" alt="" width="1150px" height="500px">
                    <p>Palaces are living legacies left behind by departed kings. They tell us many stories and let us have glimpses of a past when palaces were glorious power centers. Krishnapuram Palace too has its own tales to tell and things to show.Located in the district of Alappuzha in Kerala, near the town of Kayamkulam, Krishnapuram Palace was built in the 18th century by Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the ruler of the former princely state of Travancore. He built it after Kayamkulam was conquered and made a part of Travancore. The palace is situated near the Sree Krishnaswamy Temple in the village of Krishnapuram and can be accessed via NH 47 between the towns of Ochira and Kayamkulam. It sits atop a small hill, and is surrounded by lawns and ponds and a terraced garden. Krishnapuram Palace is built in the conventional architectural style of Kerala with gabled low roofs, narrow corridors, thick-framed doors, and dormer windows. It is built in the Pathinaru-kettu (16 blocks) style, in which rooms are built around four inner courtyards called Nadu-muttams. At the time when the building was occupied by the royal family, it was a large complex consisting of many units. However, most of the smaller units were later lost and now only the main structure has survived. This portion, that was modified and is now looked after by the Kerala State Department of Archaeology, is a three-storey building and houses heirlooms of the royal family and other objects of historical interest. The restored building has retained most of the palace’s original architectural style. A major attraction in the palace interior is the 9.8’ high mural depicting the story of Gajendra-moksham, a famous story from mythology in which Lord Vishnu comes down to the earth to save an elephant who is his ardent devotee. A double-edged sword known as Kayamkulam Vaal, a Sanskrit Bible, bronze statues, an antique Buddha of the 10th century, stone inscriptions, megalithic specimens, Pancha-loha (a combination of five metals) figurines, magnificent oil lamps, and ceremonial utensils are some of the other exhibits here. Krishnapuram Palace is open to visitors on every day except on Mondays.</p>
