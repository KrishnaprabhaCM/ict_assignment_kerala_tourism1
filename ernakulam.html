                    <p>Constituted during 1983, Dr. Salim Ali, the world famous ornithologist, is directly responsible for the wonders on display at the Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary. His famous survey of Travancore in the 1930s led to the formation of this modern day paradise for avian life. He noted that the area was rich in bird diversity and ought to be turned into a sanctuary to conserve the same. The over 300 species that reside in these tropical and deciduous forests are testament to his great vision.One can run across the Sri Lankan Frogmouth, Racket Tailed Drongo, Bronzed Drongo, White-bellied Treepie, Shama, Yellow-browed Bulbul, Rufous Babbler, Malabar Parakeet, White-bellied Blue Flycatcher and the Malabar Grey Hornbill in these parts.

                    <img src="images/ernakulam/chinese-fishing-nets.jpg" alt="" width="1150px" height="500px">
                    <p>The huge cantilevered Chinese fishing nets that that droop towards the waters like over-sized hammocks have become a hallmark that represents Fort Kochi on the tourist map. Once just a fishing accessory, it is a now a big bait for tourists. Chinese fishing nets - Cheenavala in Malayalam - is believed to have been introduced in Kochi by Chinese explorer Zheng He, from the court of the Kubla Khan. The fishing net established itself on the Kochi shores between 1350 and 1450 AD. The sight of the Chinese nets, suspended in mid air and standing in line on the beaches, when silhouetted against the sunset is breathtakingly beautiful. It is, undoubtedly, one of the most photographed sights in Kochi. For the best view of the nets, head to the Vasco da Gama Square, the narrow walkway that runs along the Fort Kochi beach.</p>
